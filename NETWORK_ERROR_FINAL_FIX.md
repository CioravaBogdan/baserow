# Baserow Network Error - FINAL RESOLUTION ✅

## Problem Summary
Baserow was showing "Network Error - Could not connect to the API server" after initial deployment fixes.

## Root Cause
Environment variables (`BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL`, `PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`, `PUBLIC_WEB_FRONTEND_URL`) were not properly propagated to containers despite being set in `docker-compose.yml`. The issue required a full container recreation rather than just a restart.

## Final Solution
1. **Environment Variables Set Correctly in docker-compose.yml:**
   ```yaml
   BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL: http://localhost:8088
   PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL: http://localhost:8088/api
   PUBLIC_WEB_FRONTEND_URL: http://localhost:8088
   ```

2. **Full Container Recreation Required:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Nginx Configuration Already Correct:**
   - Proxy to `baserow:80`
   - Increased header buffers
   - WebSocket support
   - Clean, minimal config

## Verification Results ✅

### Container Status
All containers healthy and running:
- ✅ baserow-app: Up 7 minutes (healthy)
- ✅ baserow-nginx: Up 7 minutes (healthy) 
- ✅ baserow-postgres: Up 7 minutes (healthy)
- ✅ baserow-redis: Up 7 minutes (healthy)

### API Connectivity  
- ✅ Health endpoint: `http://localhost:8088/api/_health/` returns 200 OK
- ✅ Frontend loads correctly at `http://localhost:8088`
- ✅ User registration API working (returns proper validation errors)
- ✅ Navigation between login/signup pages working
- ✅ No more "Network Error" messages

### Browser Testing (via MCP Puppeteer)
- ✅ Login page loads correctly
- ✅ Signup page loads correctly  
- ✅ Form submission reaches backend API
- ✅ API returns proper responses (e.g., "User already exists")
- ✅ Frontend-backend communication fully restored

## Key Learnings
1. **Environment variable changes require `docker-compose down && up -d`** - simple restart not sufficient
2. **Container recreation needed** when changing core environment variables
3. **MCP Puppeteer testing** was crucial for verifying actual browser behavior
4. **Full stack restart** resolves environment propagation issues

## Current Status: FULLY WORKING ✅
Baserow is now fully functional at `http://localhost:8088` with no network errors.

*Method: Full Docker stack recreation after environment variable updates*
